# **Travelling Salesman Problem**

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic problem in operations research and computer science, focusing on optimization. The problem involves a salesman who must visit a list of cities and return to the starting point. The objective is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the original city, minimizing the total travel distance or cost.
This project utilizes the classic Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) to optimize routes for concert tours, aiming to find the most efficient path through various cities. The goal is to reduce travel time and costs, enabling artists and tour managers to plan more effective and economical tours.

## Project Overview

The Concert Tour Route Optimizer is designed to solve the logistical challenges of planning concert tours by applying optimization algorithms to determine the shortest possible route that visits each venue once and returns to the origin city. This solution not only saves on travel expenses but also reduces the environmental impact of touring.

## Features

- **Optimization Algorithm**: Implements several TSP solvers to find the best route.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Offers visual maps of proposed tour routes for easy understanding and decision-making.
